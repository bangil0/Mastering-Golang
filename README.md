Compile & create a statically linked executable file
$ go build aSourceFile.go

After that, you will have a new executable file named aSourceFile:
$ file aSourceFile

In order to run aSourceFile.go without creating an executable file, you will need to execute the next command:
$ go run aSourceFile.go
